<H1>Place Holder Document</H1>

<P>Well Done!</P>

<P>This document is a place holder used when a test page needs to link
to something, but there is nothing linkable that seems particularly
relevant. Getting to this page means that the browser you are testing
succeeded in doing whatever it was supposed to do.</P>

<P>Please return to the test page and grade your browser!</P>
