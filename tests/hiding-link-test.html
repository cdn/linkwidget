<p>The link below has an onclick handler of <code>this.style.display = 'none'</code></p>

<p>In various Firefox builds from February 2004 it was observed that the unload event for the page
when following a link that hides itself when clicked (or a link contained in another element that
hides itself when clicked) would have a Text node (presumably the text content of the link) as its
originalTarget, rather than having the document being unloaded.  This would result in the link widget
not clearing itself properly on moving to the next page, because the check whether the unload event's
target was the docuement currently being viewed would fail.  (The code now uses ownerDocument to work
around this).</p>

<p><a href="hiding-link-test-2.html" onclick="this.style.display = 'none'">the test link</a></p>

<p>This bug was originally observed on <a href="http://www.musicandmeaning.net/issues/showArticle.php?artID=1.3"
>http://www.musicandmeaning.net/issues/showArticle.php?artID=1.3</a>, where the old contents of the link
toolbar would not be cleared when using the in-page navigation popup menus.</p>
